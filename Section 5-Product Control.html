<h2 id="5_3">5.3 Management of allergens<a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2>
<p>Pet food and animal feed manufacturers certificated to the Standard are required to meet the appropriate allergen management legislation in the country of intended sale of the products. Therefore, if there is no legislation relating to allergens in pet food/animal feed, this section of the Standard may be considered ‘not applicable’ for pet food or animal feed destined for those countries.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, allergen claims (e.g. gluten- or dairy-free) are made on pet food or animal feed products. Therefore, where a site makes an allergen claim on a pet food or animal feed, it is required to meet all of the requirements within section 5.3.</p>
<h3><b>Fundamental</b></h3>
<h3>5.3.1</h3>
<p>The site shall carry out an assessment of raw materials to establish the presence and likelihood of contamination (cross-contact) by allergens. This shall include a review of the raw material specifications and, where required, the acquisition of additional information from suppliers (e.g. through questionnaires to understand the allergen profile of the raw material, its ingredients and the factory in which it is produced).</p>
<h3>5.3.2</h3>
<p>The company shall identify and list allergen-containing materials handled on site. This shall include raw materials, processing aids, intermediate and finished products, and any new product development ingredients or products.</p>
<h3>5.3.3</h3>
<p>A documented risk assessment shall be carried out to identify routes of contamination (cross-contact) and establish documented policies, and procedures for handling raw materials and intermediate and finished products, to ensure cross-contamination (cross-contact) is avoided. This assessment shall include:</p>
<ul>
<li>consideration of the physical state of the allergenic material (e.g. powder, liquid, particulate)</li>
<li>identification of potential points of cross-contamination (cross-contact) through the process flow</li>
<li>assessment of the risk of allergen cross-contamination (cross-contact) at each process step</li>
<li>identification of suitable controls to reduce or eliminate the risk of cross-contamination (cross-contact)</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.3.4</h3>
<p>Procedures shall be established to ensure the effective management of allergenic materials to prevent cross-contamination (cross-contact) of products not containing the allergen. These shall include, as appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>physical or time segregation while allergen-containing materials are being stored, processed or packed</li>
<li>the use of separate or additional protective overclothing when handling allergenic materials</li>
<li>use of identified, dedicated equipment and utensils for processing</li>
<li>scheduling of production to reduce changes between products containing an allergen and products not containing the allergen</li>
<li>systems to restrict the movement of airborne dust containing allergenic material</li>
<li>waste handling and spillage controls</li>
<li>restrictions on food brought onto site by staff, visitors and contractors and for catering purposes</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.3.5</h3>
<p>Where rework is used, or reworking operations are carried out, procedures shall be implemented to ensure rework containing allergens is not used in products that do not already contain the allergen.</p>
<h3>5.3.6</h3>
<p>Where a justified, risk-based assessment demonstrates that the nature of the production process is such that cross-contamination (cross-contact) from an allergen cannot be prevented, a warning should be included on the label. Legislation, national guidelines or codes of practice shall be used when making such a warning statement.</p>
<h3>5.3.7</h3>
<p>Where a claim is made regarding the suitability of a food for individuals with a food allergy or food sensitivity (sometimes referred to as a ‘food hyper-sensitivity’), the site shall ensure that the production process is fully validated to meet the stated claim and the effectiveness of the process is routinely verified. This shall be documented.</p>
<h3>5.3.8</h3>
<p>Equipment or area-cleaning procedures shall be designed to remove or reduce to acceptable levels any potential cross-contamination (cross-contact) by allergens. The cleaning methods shall be validated to ensure that they are effective and the effectiveness of the procedure routinely verified. Cleaning equipment used to clean allergenic materials shall either be:</p>
<ul>
<li>identifiable and specific for allergen use</li>
<li>single use</li>
<li>effectively cleaned after use</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5_4">5.4 Product authenticity, claims and chain of custody<a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2>
<p>Systems shall be in place to minimise the risk of purchasing fraudulent or adulterated food raw materials and to ensure that all product descriptions and claims are legal, accurate and verified.</p>
<h3>5.4.1</h3>
<p>Where personnel are engaged in vulnerability assessments, the individual or team responsible shall understand potential food fraud risks. This shall include knowledge of raw materials used by the site and the principles of vulnerability assessment.</p>
<h3>5.4.2</h3>
<p>The company shall have processes in place to access information on historical and developing threats to the supply chain which may present a risk of adulteration or substitution of raw materials (i.e. fraudulent raw materials). Such information may come from, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>trade associations</li>
<li>government sources</li>
<li>private resource centres</li>
<li>activities completed for clause 1.1.8</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.4.3</h3>
<p>A documented vulnerability assessment shall be carried out on all food raw materials or groups of raw materials to assess the potential risk of adulteration or substitution. This shall take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>historical evidence of substitution or adulteration</li>
<li>economic factors which may make adulteration or substitution more attractive</li>
<li>ease of access to raw materials through the supply chain</li>
<li>sophistication of routine testing to identify adulterants</li>
<li>the nature of the raw material</li>
</ul>
<p>The output from this assessment shall be a documented vulnerability assessment plan.</p>
<p>This plan shall be kept under review to reflect changing economic circumstances and market intelligence which may alter the potential risks. It shall be reviewed annually and whenever there is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a change in raw materials or a supplier of raw materials</li>
<li>emergence of a new risk (e.g. known adulteration of an ingredient or developments in scientific information associated with authenticity of the site’s products or raw materials, for example, information obtained as part of clause 1.1.8)</li>
<li>following a significant product safety incident (e.g. a product recall) where the authenticity of the site’s products or raw materials is implicated</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.4.4</h3>
<p>Where raw materials are identified as being at particular risk of adulteration or substitution, the vulnerability assessment plan shall include appropriate assurance and/or testing processes to mitigate the identified risks.</p>
<h3>5.4.5</h3>
<p>Where products are labelled or claims are made on finished packs which are dependent on the status of a raw material, the status of each batch of the raw material shall be verified. These claims include:</p>
<ul>
<li>specific provenance or origin</li>
<li>breed/varietal claims</li>
<li>assured status (e.g. GLOBALG.A.P.)</li>
<li>genetically modified organism (GMO) status</li>
<li>identity preserved</li>
<li>named specific trademarked ingredients</li>
</ul>
<p>The facility shall maintain purchasing records, traceability of raw material usage and final product packing records to substantiate claims. The site shall undertake documented mass balance tests at a frequency to meet the particular requirements of any scheme it is certificated to, or in the absence of a scheme-specific requirement, at least one mass balance test every 6 months.</p>
<h3>5.4.6</h3>
<p>Where claims are made about the methods of production (e.g. organic, halal, kosher), the site shall maintain the necessary certification status in order to make such a claim.</p>
<h3>5.4.7</h3>
<p>Where a product is designed to enable a claim to be made, the company shall ensure that all claims are substantiated, and product formulation and the production process are fully validated to meet the stated claim and any legal requirements (in the country of intended sale) relating to the claim.</p>
<p>The process flow (see clause 2.5.1) for the production of products where claims are made shall be documented and potential areas for contamination or loss of identity identified.</p>
<p>Appropriate controls shall be established to ensure the integrity of the product claims.</p>
<h2 id="5_5">5.5 Product packaging<a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2>
<p>Product packaging and processes for the purchase of product packaging shall be appropriate for the intended use. Packaging shall be stored under conditions to prevent contamination and minimise deterioration.</p>
<h3>5.5.1</h3>
<p>When purchasing or specifying primary packaging, the supplier of packaging materials shall be made aware of any particular characteristics of the food or existing packaging (e.g. high fat content, pH, usage conditions such as microwaving, other packaging used on the product, use of recyclable or reusable packaging materials) which may affect packaging suitability.</p>
<p>Certificates of conformity or other evidence shall be available for primary packaging to confirm it complies with applicable food safety legislation and is suitable for its intended use.</p>
<h3>5.5.2</h3>
