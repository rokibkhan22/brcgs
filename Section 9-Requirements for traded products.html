<p>Non-conformities against clauses within section 9 of the Standard will be recorded on the audit report and included in the calculation of the site’s grade.</p>
<p>Where a site has traded food products or food raw materials on site but wishes them to be excluded from the scope of the audit, this will be recorded as an exclusion from scope on the audit report.</p>
