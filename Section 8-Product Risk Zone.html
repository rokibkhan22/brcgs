<h1>8. Product Risk Zones- high risk, high care and ambient high caere</h1>
<p>Where a site produces products where the production process, or part of it, requires high risk, high care and/or ambient high care production zone (see clause 4.3.1 for this assessment and Appendix 2 for the definition of these production zones), all the relevant requirements from sections 1-7 of the standard must be fullfilled in addition to the requirements in this sections </p><br/>
<p><strong>The site shall be able to demonstrate that production facilities and controls are suitable to prevent pathogen contamination of products.</strong></p>

<h3>8.1.1</h3>
<p>The map of the site (see clause 4.3.2) shall include the location of the pathogen control step(s).</p>
<h3>8.1.2</h3>
<p>Where high-risk areas are part of the manufacturing site, there shall be physical segregation between these areas and other parts of the site. Segregation shall take into account the flow of product, the nature of the materials (including packaging), the equipment, the personnel, the chemicals, the disposal of waste, the flow of air, the air quality and the provision of utilities (including drains). The location of transfer points shall not compromise the segregation between high-risk areas and ot...

    <h3>8.1.3</h3>
<p>Where high-care areas are part of the manufacturing site, there should be physical segregation between these areas and other parts of the site. Segregation shall take into account the flow of product, the nature of materials (including packaging), the equipment, the personnel, the chemicals, the disposal of waste, the flow of air, the air quality and the provision of utilities (including drains).</p>
<p>Where physical barriers are not in place, the site shall have undertaken a documented risk assessment of the potential for cross-contamination, and effective, validated processes shall be in place to protect products from contamination, including the procedures for changeover from low-risk to high-care.</p>
<h3>8.1.4</h3>
<p>Where ambient high-care areas are required, a documented risk assessment shall be completed to determine the risk of cross-contamination with pathogens. The risk assessment shall take into account the potential sources of microbiological contamination and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the raw materials and products</li>
<li>the flow of raw materials, packaging, products, equipment, personnel and waste</li>
<li>air flow and quality</li>
<li>the provision and location of utilities (including drains)</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective processes shall be in place to protect the final product from microbiological contamination. These processes may include segregation, management of process flow or other controls.</p>
<h2 id="8_2">8.2 Building fabric in high-risk and high-care zones<a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2>
<h3>8.2.1</h3>
<p>Where sites include high-risk or high-care facilities, there shall be a map of the drains for these areas which shows the direction of flow and the location of any equipment fitted to prevent the backup of waste water. The flow from drains shall not present a risk of contamination to the high-risk/care area.</p>
<h3>8.2.2</h3>
<p>High-risk areas shall be supplied with sufficient changes of filtered air. The filter specification used and frequency of air changes shall be documented, based on a risk assessment that takes into account the source of the air and the requirement to maintain a positive air pressure relative to the surrounding areas.</p>
<h3>8.2.3</h3>
<p>Where sites include removable walls as part of the design of the high-risk or high-care area (e.g. to allow occasional movement of large items or specialist maintenance equipment), procedures shall be in place to ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>removable walls are tight fitting</li>
<li>their use is managed</li>
<li>movement of the walls is authorised and is completed only by trained and authorised staff</li>
<li>cleaning and reconditioning procedures are in place and completed prior to production</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8_3">8.3 Equipment and maintenance in high-risk and high-care zones<a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2>
<h3>8.3.1</h3>
<p>Maintenance activities undertaken in high-risk and high-care areas shall respect the segregation requirements of the area. Wherever possible, tools and equipment shall be dedicated for use in that area and retained there.</p>
<h3>8.3.2</h3>
<p>Where equipment is removed from the high-risk or high-care area, the site shall have a procedure to ensure the cleanliness and removal of contamination hazards before the equipment is accepted back into the area.</p>
<p>Records of acceptance back into the area shall be maintained.</p>
<h3>8.3.3</h3>
<p>Where portable equipment (e.g. handheld devices) and battery-charging equipment is used in high-risk or high-care areas, these items shall either:</p>
<ul>
<li>be visually distinctive and dedicated for use in that area, or</li>
<li>have specific procedures (e.g. a full clean) to ensure that their use does not result in contamination</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8_4">8.4 Staff facilities for high-risk and high-care zones<a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2>
<h3>8.4.1</h3>
<p>Where an operation includes a high-risk or high-care area, personnel shall enter via a specially designated changing facility at the entrance to the area. The changing facilities shall incorporate the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>clear instructions for the order of changing into and out of dedicated protective clothes to prevent the contamination of clean clothing</li>
<li>protective clothing that is visually distinct from that worn in other areas and which shall not be worn outside the area</li>
<li>a hand-washing routine during the changing procedure to prevent contamination of the clean clothing</li>
<li>hand-washing and disinfection facilities situated prior to and on entry for high-care areas</li>
<li>dedicated site footwear provided by the site and not worn outside the factory</li>
<li>an effective control of footwear to prevent the introduction of pathogens into the area</li>
</ul>
<p>A programme of environmental monitoring shall be used to assess the effectiveness of footwear controls.</p>
<h2 id="8_5">8.5 Housekeeping and hygiene in high-risk and high-care zones<a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2>
<h3>8.5.1</h3>
<p>Environmental cleaning procedures in high-care/high-risk areas shall consider the different microbiological risks associated with each production risk zone.</p>
<h3>8.5.2</h3>
<p>Microbiological limits for acceptable and unacceptable cleaning performance shall be defined for high-risk/high-care production risk zones.</p>
<h3>8.5.3</h3>
<p>Equipment used for cleaning in high-care and high-risk areas shall be:</p>
<ul>
<li>visually distinctive and dedicated for use in that area</li>
<li>hygienically designed and fit for purpose</li>
<li>cleaned and stored in a hygienic manner to prevent contamination</li>
</ul>
<h3>8.5.4</h3>
<p>Where the site uses CIP equipment, controls must be in place to prevent the risk of contamination from reused rinse solutions between different risk areas.</p>
<h2 id="8_6">8.6 Waste and waste disposal in high-risk, high-care zones<a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2>
<h3>8.6.1</h3>
<p>Waste disposal systems shall ensure that the risk of contamination of products is minimised through the control of potential cross-contamination.</p>
<p>Risk assessment shall consider the movement and flow of waste and waste containers.</p>
<h2 id="8_7">8.7 Protective clothing in high-risk and high-care zones<a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to Top</a></h2>
<h3>8.7.1</h3>
<p>Laundering of protective clothing shall be done by an approved contracted or in-house laundry using defined criteria to validate the effectiveness of the laundering process. Procedures must ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>adequate segregation between dirty and cleaned clothes</li>
<li>segregation between clothes for different risk areas</li>
<li>effective cleaning and sterilisation</li>
<li>protection of cleaned clothes from contamination until use</li>
</ul>
<h3>8.7.2</h3>
<p>Protective clothing cleaned by contracted or in-house laundries shall be audited based on risk.</p>
<h3>8.7.3</h3>
<p>Protective clothing shall be changed at an appropriate frequency based on risk, and at a minimum daily.</p>
