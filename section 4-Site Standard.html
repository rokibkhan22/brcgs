<li>tests of the metal detector by passing successive test packs through the unit at typical line operating speed</li>
<li>checks of failsafe systems fitted to the detection and rejection systems</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, where metal detectors are incorporated on conveyors, the test piece shall be passed as close as possible to the least sensitive area of the metal detector (usually the centre of the metal detector aperture). Wherever possible, the test piece shall be inserted within a clearly identified sample pack of the food being produced at the time of the test.</p>
<p>Where in-line metal detectors are used, the test piece shall be placed in the product flow wherever this is possible, and the correct timing of the rejection system to remove identified contamination shall be validated. Testing of in-line metal detectors shall be completed during both line start-up and at the end of the production period.</p>
<h4>4.10.3.5</h4>
<p>X-ray equipment testing procedures shall, at a minimum, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>use of test pieces incorporating a sphere of suitable material (e.g. a typical contaminant) of a known diameter selected on the basis of risk. The test pieces shall be marked with the size and type of test material contained</li>
<li>tests carried out using separate test pieces</li>
<li>a test to prove that both the detection and rejection mechanisms are working effectively under normal working conditions</li>
<li>tests of the X-ray equipment by passing successive test packs through the unit at typical line operating speed</li>
<li>checks of failsafe systems fitted to the detection and rejection systems</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, where X-ray equipment is incorporated on conveyors, the test piece shall be passed as close as possible to the least sensitive area of the X-ray equipment. Wherever possible, the test piece shall be inserted into a clearly identified sample pack of the food being produced at the time of the test.</p>
<p>Where in-line X-ray equipment is used, the test piece shall be placed in the product flow wherever this is possible, and the correct timing of the rejection system to remove identified contamination shall be validated. Testing of in-line equipment shall be completed both during line start-up and at the end of the production period.</p>
<h3>4.10.4 Magnets</h3>
<h4>4.10.4.1</h4>
<p>The type, location and strength of magnets shall be fully documented.</p>
<p>Procedures shall be in place for the inspection, cleaning, strength testing and integrity checks of magnets used for food safety purposes, including final product testing, e.g. to remove product contamination. Records of all checks shall be maintained.</p>
<h3>4.10.5 Optical sorting equipment</h3>
<h4>4.10.5.1</h4>
<p>Optical sorting equipment used for final product testing shall be checked in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions or recommendations. Checks shall be documented.</p>
<h3>4.10.6 Container cleanliness – glass jars, cans and other rigid containers</h3>
<h4>4.10.6.1</h4>
<p>Based on risk assessment, procedures shall be implemented to minimise foreign-body contamination originating from the packaging container (e.g. jars, cans and other pre-formed rigid containers). This may include the use of covered conveyors, container inversion and foreign-body removal through rinsing with water or air jets.</p>
<h4>4.10.6.2</h4>
<p>The effectiveness of the container-cleaning equipment shall be checked and recorded during each production. Where the system incorporates a rejection system for dirty or damaged containers, the check shall incorporate a test of both the detection and effective rejection of the test container.</p>
