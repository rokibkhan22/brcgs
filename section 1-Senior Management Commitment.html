<h3>1.2.4</h3>
<p>
  If the site does not have the appropriate in-house knowledge of food safety, authenticity, legality or quality, external expertise (e.g. food safety consultants) may be used; however, the day-to-day management of the food safety systems shall remain the responsibility of the company.
